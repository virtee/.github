## Briefly

VirTEE is an open community dedicated to developing open source tools for the bring-up, attestation, and
management of Trusted Execution Environments.

## Projects

VirTEE's projects include system libraries, command line tools, and attestation components that are not built for
one specific virtualization platform. The goal of VirTEE is to aid developers and administrators in bring-up and
attestation of TEEs to their projects.

## Maintainers

VirTEE is a collaborative project. Each repository contains a `CODEOWNERS` file that lists the maintainers for
that specific project.

## Code of Conduct

The project applies a Code of Conduct that can be found [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community

VirTEE can be reached by mail at `virtee-security@redhat.com` as well as our [Matrix chat instance](https://matrix.to/#/#virtee:matrix.org).
Further information can be found on [our website](https://virtee.io).
